	<h2>About Us</h2>
	<p>Our ride is a low speed electric vehicle modeled after a 1930s roadster owned and operated by Randy and Carol Briley. The car is battery powered and we recharge our batteries with the North Myrtle Beach sunshine! Not quite a taxi, but not a limousine; not a shuttle, nor a tour bus; we've created our own category to get you around town in style.<img src="{{site.url}}/images/randy-and-carol.jpeg" width="200" height="150" / ></p>
	<span class="italic">we also offer </span><h2>Private Tours</h2>
	<p>From your pick-up point in Windy Hill down Ocean Boulevard to the intracoastal waterway and Barefoot Landing, you'll get an overview and history of the area while you enjoy a ride in a stylish, fun, and <span class="green">Green</span> car.</p>

	<p>All tours are $40.00 for up to four people in your party</p>

	<p>Tour times are 9, 10, and 11 a.m. - Call to book now!</p>
