	<h2 class="center">About Us</h2>
	<p>Our ride is a low speed electric vehicle modeled after a 1930s roadster owned and operated by Randy and Carol Briley. The car is battery powered, and we recharge our batteries with the North Myrtle Beach sunshine! Not quite a taxi, but not a limousine; not a shuttle nor a tour bus; we've created our own category to get you around town in style.</p>
